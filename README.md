# classify_mnist_numbers_with_MLP
Multilayer perceptron is used to classify numbers 0-9 from MNIST data. The project is taught by Flare Zhao in his course, "Python 3 Intro to Artificial Intelligence".

The handwritten images of numbers from 0-9 in MNIST datasets are used in the project. 

Multilayer perceptron was setted up with 1 input layer with input shape, 784, 2 hidden layers each has 392 units with sigmoid as their activation function. The output layer has 10 units with softmax as its activation function.

The first 10 prediction results were visualized along with the corresponding images.
